<h1>All about proggraming</h1>
<p>Programming is the process of writing instructions that a computer can execute. These instructions are written in programming languages like Python, Java, C++, JavaScript, and many others.</p>

<h2>Popular Programming Languages</h2>
<p>Python  Easy to learn, widely used in AI, data science, and web development.
    JavaScript  Essential for web development (front-end and back-end).
    C++  High-performance language used in game development and system programming.
    Java  Commonly used in Android development and enterprise applications.
    C#  Popular for game development with Unity.
    SQL  Used for managing databases.</p>

    <h3>who created proggraming languages?</h3>
    <p>Programming languages were created by various computer scientists, engineers, and researchers over time. Here are some key figures behind some of the most influential languages:

        Ada Lovelace (1840s)  Considered the first programmer, she wrote an algorithm for Charles Babbageâ€™s Analytical Engine.
        John Backus (1957)  Led the team that created Fortran, the first high-level programming language.
        Dennis Ritchie (1972)  Created C, which became the foundation for many later languages.
        Bjarne Stroustrup (1983)  Developed C++, an extension of C with object-oriented features.
        Guido van Rossum (1991)  Created Python, known for its simplicity and readability.
        James Gosling (1995)  Led the development of Java, a platform-independent language.
        Brendan Eich (1995)  Developed JavaScript, widely used in web development.
        Yukihiro Matsumoto (1995)  Created Ruby, emphasizing programmer happiness and productivity.
        Rasmus Lerdorf (1995)  Developed PHP, a server-side scripting language for web development.
        Anders Hejlsberg (2000)  Designed C#, a Microsoft language similar to Java.
        Many programming languages are the result of collaborative efforts, especially newer ones like Swift (Apple, 2014) and Rust (Mozilla, 2010s).</p>
